# Inkwell App

This is a web app which allows users to send letters to each other as digital pen-pals, built with Next.js and written in TypeScript. See the demo video and meet the team [here](https://northcoders.com/project-phase/inkwell).

This web app is supported by a backend API - find the repo [here](https://github.com/Auchendale/inkwell-frontend) and the hosted version [here](https://inkwell-backend-kvij.onrender.com/api/).

Due to the free service used to host the API, when first using the app and loading the users it may take a minute or so to retrieve the data; after this inital loading period using the app will be much faster.
